# Runtime verification

The generated service keeps executable runtime checks beside the source. From a
clean checkout, run:

```bash
make tools
make verify
```

`make verify` checks that typed configuration regenerates without a content
change, rejects stale formatting or module metadata, and runs `go test`,
`go vet`, `go build`, and `go mod verify`.

The runtime integration tests start real loopback gRPC and admin HTTP listeners.
They check gRPC health, disabled reflection, health/readiness/metrics responses,
Kratos error encoding, middleware recovery/metadata/validation, request metrics,
trace-correlated structured logging, and graceful application stop. These tests
prove only the generic local runtime. They do not prove a database, broker,
provider, external telemetry backend, container, Kubernetes deployment, or
business contract.

For vulnerability and secret scans, a reproducible CycloneDX JSON runtime SBOM,
and notice/license-inventory consistency checks (with `jq` available):

```bash
make supply-chain-tools
make audit
```

Vulnerability results are valid only for the scanner and database state at the
time of execution. The pinned Gitleaks module scans all local Git refs with its
embedded detector set and redacts any finding in command output; CI requests a
full-history checkout before running it. The SBOM
generator requires a committed revision, ignores only its own output while
checking cleanliness, and builds an isolated synthetic Git snapshot from all
tracked files except the prior SBOM. This prevents both a self-reference and
accidental discovery of a parent Git repository through `TMPDIR`.

The committed SBOM targets the Linux/amd64 runtime graph and excludes test-only
dependencies. Byte reproducibility is claimed only for the same source snapshot
and recorded CycloneDX binary; its own binary hashes intentionally make output
from a separately built scanner distinguishable.

For a newly generated repository, first commit the generated source, then run
`make supply-chain-tools` and `make audit`, review the result, and commit
`docs/scaffold/bom.cdx.json`. The CI gate rejects a missing or stale SBOM and
reruns the scanner and notice/license-evidence checks. The retained upstream
notice is not a project license; choose the service's license before publication.
